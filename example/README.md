## Understand the tech

The following figure shows the workflow of how clients send and receive peer-to-peer messages:

![agora_chat](https://docs.agora.io/en/assets/images/get-started-sdk-understand-009486abec0cc276183ab535456cf889.png)

1. Clients retrieve a token from your app server.
2. Client A and Client B log in to Agora Chat.
3. Client A sends a message to Client B. The message is sent to the Agora Chat server and the server delivers the message to Client B. When Client B receives the message, the SDK triggers an event. Client B listens for the event and gets the message.

- Flutter 2.10 or later
- Dart 2.16 or later
- macOS

1. Set up ChatConfig, fill in your appkey and login account and agoraToken information.
2. Clone this project to local.
3. open `example`.
4. run `flutter pub get`;
5. If you want to use your own App Key for the experience, you can edit the `example/lib/main.dart` file.

Replaces `appKey`, `userId`, and `agoraToken` and with your own App Key, user ID, and user token generated in Agora Console.

```dart
class ChatConfig {
  static const String appKey = "";
  static const String userId = "";
  static const String agoraToken = '';
}
```
